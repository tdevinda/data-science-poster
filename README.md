### Challenges in the dataset
Indoor morbidity and mortality data is available only up to 2019. Therefore it was not possible to give a more updated version of the study.


### Disclaimer
The predictions and the recommendations made are assumed to be done by the end of 2019. Although in the actual situation, all this changed and the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant changes to the patient behaviour, health personnel distributions as well as the general operating norms of the health sector.



### Assumptions made
Data is assumed to be accurate in the source documents. 
Recommendation made under the assumption of a regular patient growth and considering only the information in the source documents. In contrast, in 2020, the COVID pandemic caused this behaviour to alter significantly.
